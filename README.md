# Four Across Game

I am following along with Treehouse's challenge project, 'Four in a Row' game.

Some code may differ from Treehouse's tutorial as I am trying to work through each step before seeing the solution. 

Learning goals of this project are:
* Object-oriented JavaScript
* App Design
* DOM interaction
